            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Bhagat Singh was an Indian revolutionary who played a pivotal role in the Indian independence movement. He was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, India, to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati. He was deeply influenced by the political turmoil of the time and was drawn towards revolutionary activities from a young age.
              Singh became involved in the freedom struggle against British rule during his college days. He was a prominent member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), which advocated for complete independence from British rule and aimed to achieve it through revolutionary means.
              One of the most notable acts of Bhagat Singh was his involvement in the Lahore Conspiracy Case, where he and his associates planned to assassinate James A. Scott, a British police officer known for his brutalities against Indians. However, the plan failed, and instead, they ended up killing J.P. Saunders, a British police officer.
              Bhagat Singh and his comrades were arrested and put on trial for the murder of J.P. Saunders. During the trial, Singh and his co-accused used the court as a platform to propagate their revolutionary ideas and expose the atrocities of British colonialism.
              Despite facing harsh treatment and torture in prison, Bhagat Singh remained steadfast in his beliefs and never wavered from his commitment to the cause of Indian independence. He became an icon of resistance and inspired millions of Indians with his courage and sacrifice.
              On March 23, 1931, Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, was hanged to death by the British authorities in Lahore Central Jail. Their martyrdom sparked widespread outrage and played a significant role in galvanizing the Indian masses against British rule.
              Bhagat Singh's legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians to fight against injustice and tyranny. He is revered as a national hero and a symbol of courage and sacrifice in the struggle for freedom."</p>
